# Air Traffic Control

With the increasing demand in air traffic, new systems are required to ensure an efficient and optimized management of the air space. 
These systems must be scalable, with the main goal of avoiding collisions and minimizing flight delays.

This project presents a multiagent system that has the ability to simulate an airspace and its management. 
For this, three types of agents are used: Interface (AI), Aircraft (AA), and Station (AE). 
The first has the function of presenting the user with information about the system in real time, while the other types of agents simulate the respective real entities, focusing on their performance in negotiation processes between them.

In this system, a decentralized approach is applied.
Each AA is responsible for managing its flight route, communicating with the other aircraft in order to control possible collisions.
