# Shift Management System

At the beginning of each school year, the course directors face problems relating to the allocation of timetables to students, the management of classrooms, the distribution of curricular units by teachers, among others. It is the responsibility of the course directors to ensure that all students have a timetable that allows them to attend classes in all curricular units in which they are enrolled, without overlapping. 
This practical work aims to build a system that allows not only to allocate students in the respective shifts, but also to ensure that they can make changes in their schedule and avoid overlapping classes.
