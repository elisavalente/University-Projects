# Stress Tracker from Biometric Data

Stress is an intrinsic component of human beings that can have both positive and negative effects on their behavior. 
The stress response is determined by the ability to perceive an event or problem and, depending on the level of stress you are facing, you may have different responses.
As such, analysing human behavior and trying to predict the state of stress that a person is going through is crucial to understand the response capability of an individual.

In this way, information about the behavior and the level of stress of university students during an exam was collected.
With these data, it is possible to create a model that, through certain characteristics, can predict the level of stress that students are experiencing.
