# Stratus Cloud Management

Stratus was the last Informatics Engineering Project aimed to build our own ideas and thinking about the process of creating a start-up business.
The application Stratus was developed with one goal in mind: optimize, simplify and abstract the process of provisioning resources and deployment services on multiple cloud environments.

- The project was developed in several different phases:

	- finding similar applications and why the Stratus would be better than the existing ones;
	- evaluate the business where this app would be used;
	- elaborate the business model and the identify all costs associated with starting the business;
	- build the entire application

- Application stack:
	- The **backend** (REST API) was developed using [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) (Express), Mongo and Redis;
	- The **frontend** (Web App) was developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/);
