# Students Evaluations

Through a set of data related to student's alcohol consumption in Portuguese secondary schools, it is intended to explore the influence of several factors on the students obtained grades.
In addition to alcohol consumption, the personal and social characteristics of each student are also analysed.
Thus, it is expected to conclude which of these have a significant influence on school performance and how they affect, positively or negatively, the student's final classification.
